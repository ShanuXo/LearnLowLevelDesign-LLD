# Defination
LLD or low-level design is a component-level design process that follows step by step refinement process,
LLD, or Low-Level Design, is a phase in the software development process where detailed system components,
and their interactions are specified. It involves converting the high-level design into a more detailed blueprint,
addressing specific algorithms, data structures, and interfaces. LLD serves as a guide for developers during coding,
ensuring the accurate and efficient implementation of the systemâ€™s functionality. LLD describes class diagrams with the
help of methods and relations between classes and program specs. 

# Remember 
Low-level designing is also known as object-level designing or micro-level or detailed designing.
